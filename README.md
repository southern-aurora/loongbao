## How was Loongbao born?

Before creating Loongbao (龙包, a homonym for "[小笼包](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaolongbao)" in Chinese), I had tried many frameworks, but I didn't find one that made me feel comfortable enough during development.

Finally, I decided to create a framework myself. She reduces the mental burden and frees the brain through many clever designs, while also taking into account performance.

At this time, Bun's `1.0` version was released. I decided to use her to write this new framework, which is Loongbao.
